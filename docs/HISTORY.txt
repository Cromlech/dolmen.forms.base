Changelog
=========

2.4 (2012-05-09)
----------------

* ``dolmen.forms.base`` now uses ``cromlech.browser >= 0.5`` definitions.
  Changes have been made to use all the packages of that same batch,
  including ``dolmen.location``.

* Dependency on ``grokcore.security`` has been removed.


2.3 (2012-04-17)
----------------

* IFormData now implements cromlech.browser.IForm


2.2 (2012-01-30)
----------------

* Added a new marker functionality : the SuccessMarker. A success marker
  is the marker returned by an action in case of failure or success.
  This marker holds information regarding a possible redirection. The
  proper redirection handling has been added to `updateForm` to ensure that
  the correct exception is raised.

  Please note that this change is backward compatible and doesn't imply
  any change in existing code. Furthermore, the http redirection exception
  can be raised directly in the action code, but this marker mechanism
  helps to identify what kind of result has been issued and, if `updateForm`
  is overriden, this info can be used to trigger handlers, logging...


2.1 (2012-01-20)
----------------

* test on postOnly

* added formMethod so you can use Get insead of post

* widgets now have a visible property to know if we shall display label


2.0 (2012-01-17)
----------------

* The ``__call__`` method is now aware of the new `make_response` method
  inherited from the `View` component. This makes it much easier to have
  a layout and to override the response behavior. However, as a result,
  the `layout_form_renderer` util function is gone. Read the changelog
  from ``dolmen.view`` for more information.

* the module `forms` has been renamed `components` to unify the naming
  through all the ``dolmen`` namespace. The API is exposed normally, and
  packages using the previously exposed API should be see any difference.
  If you imported directly from `forms`, please change your code accordingly.


2.0b2 (2012-01-06)
------------------

* `StandaloneForm` and `Form` do now have a proper `__call__` method,
  returning an ``IResponse`` object.

* Added a redirection exception handling in the `__call__` method of the
  `IHTTPRenderer` forms.

* Updated tests to use the latest changes (split) in the ``cromlech.io``
  and ``cromlech.browser`` package.

* Added an utility function to query the layout of a form.


2.0b1 (2011-11-24)
------------------

* Added i18n last fixes based on `cromlech.i18n`.


2.0a4 (2011-09-19)
------------------

* Validators are now form-aware.


2.0a3 (2011-08-17)
------------------

* NO_VALUE only if data not present, empty data does not mean no value


2.0a2 (2011-06-13)
------------------

* Added the IGNORE behavior to the Fields collection.


2.0a1 (2011-05-10)
------------------

* we are now working with cromlech stack
* forked and migrated zeam.form
 

1.0b3 (2010-10-27)
------------------

* Util method ``set_fields_data`` now makes sure that, even if a data
  entry doesn't have a corresponding field, it doesn't raise an error,
  as it was supposed to do.


1.0b2 (2010-10-20)
------------------

* Both ``zeam.form`` and ``zope.schema`` Fields are useable in a Form,
  now. The changes have been made in the inline validation, to take
  care of both types.

* Now we are using formErrors from ``zeam.form.base`` Form instead of our
  own formError method.

* The `InvariantsValidation` is now declared thanks to the
  ``dataValidators`` mechanism introduces by ``zeam.form.base`` 1.0.

* The package is now tested under Grok 1.2.


1.0b1 (2010-06-25)
------------------

* The package now uses the latest version of ``zeam.form.base``, that
  separates the `extractData` from the `validateData`. It allows to
  validate invariants in a cleaner way, without overriding generic
  code.

* The DeprecationWarning in invariants validation is gone. It now uses
  the representation of the exception and no longer the `message`
  attribute.

* The package now exposes the base ``zeam.form`` markers.


1.0a2 (2010-06-25)
------------------

* `ApplicationForm` now validates interfaces invariants.

* `ApplicationForm` is now localized, since it provides a contextual
  i18nLanguage attribute.

* Added tests


1.0a1 (2010-06-02)
------------------

* Added a base Form model : `ApplicationForm`

* ``dolmen.forms.base`` no longer uses ``z3c.form`` but is now based
  on the ``zeam.form`` Form framework

* Added several helpers functions, to extract changes Attributes and
  notify events

* Added tests


0.1 (2009-10-25)
----------------

* Initial release
