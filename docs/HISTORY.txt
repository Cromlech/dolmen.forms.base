Changelog
=========

1.0b1 (2010-06-25)
------------------

* The package now uses the latest version of ``zeam.form.base``, that
  separates the `extractData` from the `validateData`. It allows to
  validate invariants in a cleaner way, without overriding generic
  code.

* The DeprecationWarning in invariants validation is gone. It now uses
  the representation of the exception and no longer the `message`
  attribute.

* The package now exposes the base ``zeam.form`` markers.


1.0a2 (2010-06-25)
------------------

* `ApplicationForm` now validates interfaces invariants.

* `ApplicationForm` is now localized, since it provides a contextual
  i18nLanguage attribute.

* Added tests
